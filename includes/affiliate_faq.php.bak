define('TEXT_INFORMATION', "<p><strong>What is an Affiliate Program? </strong><br>
  An Affiliate Program allows you to place links to our products on your web site. 
  By placing these links, visitors to your site have the opportunity to buy products. 
  If a product is purchased through a link on your web site, we pay you a commission 
  for each sale.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should I join?</strong><br>
  There are many reasons to join! Becoming an Affiliate is free, and you 'll make 
  money with very little effort. As an Affiliate, you can add value to the content 
  of your site. We take the customer order and handle all payments. All you do 
  is cash the check!</p>
<p> <strong>Does it cost me anything to become an Affiliate? </strong><br>
  No! It's absolutely free to join our Affiliate Program. There is no charge to 
  apply and there is no minimum sales requirement. </p>
<p><strong>Can a web site outside the United States or Canada be an Affiliate? 
  </strong><br>
  Yes. We welcome Affiliates from anywhere in the world; however, customers that 
  buy from our site must pay in US dollars. All commission payment checks to Affiliates 
  are in US dollars.</p>
<p> <strong>I operate more than one web site. Can I still be an Affiliate?</strong><br>
  Yes. You can have multiple sites as an Affiliate. You can have one Affiliate 
  account with us that will include all of your sites. You can track the progress 
  of each of your sites separately and be paid with only one commission check. 
</p>
<p> <strong>How do I sign up?</strong><br>
  First, you must read and accept our Affiliate Agreement Then, you complete our 
  online affiliate Application Form. After your application is submitted, we will 
  send you an email with information on how to get started. </p>
<p> <strong>How does the program work? </strong><br>
  An Affiliate Program allows you to make money by referring customers to our 
  web site. You do this by placing links on your site. Every time you refer a 
  customer to us and that customer makes a purchase, you earn a commission. In 
  every month that you have earned more than $25, we send you a check for a percentage 
  of the sales you referred to our site. It's that easy!</p>
<p> <strong>Is my web site eligible to become an Affiliate? </strong><br>
  Most sites will qualify to participate in the program. Anyone may submit an 
  application, but we do reserve the right to refuse membership to a site or revoke 
  a site's membership at any time if we deem that it contains objectionable material.</p>
<p> <strong>What are my responsibilities an as Affiliate? </strong><br>
  The only thing you are responsible for is using the tag generator, creative, 
  and links, so you can create and place links on your site. We handle everything 
  else.</p>
<p> <strong>What are our responsibilities? </strong><br>
  We will provide you with the tools and support you need to maximize sales through 
  your site. We also handle orders, shipping, and billing for all customers you 
  refer to us.</p>
<p> <strong>I don't have a web site Can I still apply?</strong><br>
  Unfortunately, no. In order for us to accept you as an Affiliate, we must be 
  able to view your web site.</p>
<p> <strong>What if I operate more than one web site? </strong><br>
  You can have multiple sites under one affiliate account. You can create links 
  specifically for each site and generate separate reports for each site. You 
  will receive one commission check for all sites.</p>
<p> <strong>How do I change my account information?</strong><br>
  Once you have been accepted as an Affiliate, you will be given access to our 
  affiliate area, so you can modify your account information.</p>
<p> <strong>Will becoming an Affiliate increase traffic to my site? </strong><br>
  Our Affiliate Program is a revenue-sharing program. It is not designed to help 
  you increase traffic to your site; however, it enhances your site with content, 
  so your user return rate may be higher. You will also be given access to our 
  online affiliate support forum so you can learn how to increase traffic to your 
  site and earn more money.</p>
<p> <strong>How do I create links? </strong><br>
  We have an automatic tag generator on that creates HTML that you cut and paste 
  into your web site. It is so easy to use even beginners can create links in 
  seconds. The tag generator allows you to create hundreds of types of links to 
  our products and full page creatives.</p>
<p> <strong>Where should I place the links on my site? </strong><br>
  You should place links where they are easy for your site visitors to find, such 
  as your homepage. Some areas you may want to place your links include your home 
  page, your navigation bar, and any other traffic areas. If you place the links 
  in an easily accessible location on your site, your visitors will be more likely 
  to make a purchase.</p>
<p> <strong>How often should I update my links? </strong><br>
  You should update links to our products frequently. We are constantly adding 
  new products, so you should create new links that fit the interests of your 
  visitors. Using our dynamic full page creatives you can have fresh content on 
  your site everyday.</p>
<p> <strong>Can I use your content on my site? </strong><br>
  No, but suggested graphics and descriptive texts will be made available to you 
  and you are recommended to use them.</p>
<p> <strong>How much can I earn? </strong><br>
  We can't predict how much you will earn from our Affiliate Program because we 
  don't know anything about your web site or your visitors. We will tell you that 
  we have affiliates earning thousands of dollars every month.</p>
<p> <strong>How do I know how much commission I've earned? </strong><br>
  Through affiliate interface you can access reports, which are updated daily, 
  that provide information on impressions, click thorough, orders, shipments, 
  and commissions earned.</p>
<p> <strong>How often do I get paid?</strong><br>
  We will send you a check for a percentage of the sales you referred to our site 
  every calendar month, provided you earned more than $25. </p>
<p> <strong>Do I earn commissions on my own purchases? </strong><br>
  The Program is intended for commercial use only and you may not purchase Products 
  through the Program for your own use.</p>
<p> <strong>What about product returns?</strong><br>
  If a user returns a product for a refund, or if credit card charges are reversed 
  due to a dispute or credit card fraud, your account will be debited for any 
  commission earned on that transaction.</p>
<p> <strong>How can I monitor my sales? </strong><br>
  You can monitor your sales by accessing reports as often as you like through 
  your admin section.</p>
<p> <strong>Who processes orders and handles customer service? </strong><br>
  We do all of that for the customers that you refer to our site. All you have 
  to do is place links on your site. We do the rest! </p>
<p> <strong>How will you know that the orders came from my site? </strong><br>
  All links from your site to our site contain a unique identifier so that every 
  time a user comes to us via your site, we know to credit you when a purchase 
  is made. This is only possible, though, when you create all of your links with 
  the tag generator on pur affiliate interface.</p>
<p> <strong>How often can I run reports? </strong><br>
  You can run reports daily if you wish. Our affiliate reporting area, is updated 
  daily with the latest information about your site.</p>
<p> <strong>I operate more than one web site. Can you track them separately but 
  pay me with one commission check? </strong><br>
  Yes. You can have multiple sites under one Affiliate account. You can create 
  links and generate reports specifically for each site, but you will receive 
  one commission check for all of your sites. To set up an account with multiple 
  sites, please contact us at affiliate@usitrip.com with the names and URLs of
